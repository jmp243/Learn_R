## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

##### Section 1: What is R?

### A free open-source software capable of statistical analysis and graphical displays.

## R programming language is case-sensitive which means L and l are read as different characters. R is a fancy calculator. Before we get started read up on R shortcuts. https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE

## Comparable Software Programming to R

MATLAB - Programming language with statistical features

Mathematica - A software package with statistical feature

SAS - Comprehensible statistical software package

SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) - Comprehensible statistical package

Python - Programming language with data science packages

```{python}
import pandas as pd

print("hello world")
```


```{r}
print("hello world")
```

#### Section 2: Simple uses for R? ####
```{r}
9+12
```

```{r}
43*34+(4/3)-12
```

```{r}
print(29+1)
```

## you can do some basic stats
```{r}
mean(a)
```

```{r}
sd(a)
```

#### Section 3: Strengths of R in creating indices ####
You can create a little index
```{r}
a <- c(2,5,65,43,3)
```

```{r}
b <- c(1:5)
b <- as.numeric(b)
```

### creating a matrix 
```{r}
c <- rbind(a,b)
d <- cbind(a,b)
```
