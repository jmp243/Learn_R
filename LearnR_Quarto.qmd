## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).

##### Section 1: What is R?

### A free open-source software capable of statistical analysis and graphical displays.

## R programming language is case-sensitive which means L and l are read as different characters. R is a fancy calculator. Before we get started read up on R shortcuts. https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE

## Comparable Software Programming to R

MATLAB - Programming language with statistical features

Mathematica - A software package with statistical feature

SAS - Comprehensible statistical software package

SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) - Comprehensible statistical package

Python - Programming language with data science packages


```{python}
import pandas as pd

name = "Jane Doe"
num_samples = 150
temperature = 37.5
flag = True

# List - ordered collection
measurements = [23.1, 24.5, 22.8, 23.9, 24.2]
patient_ids = ["P001", "P002", "P003"]

# Dictionary - key-value pairs
patient_data = {
    "id": "P001",
    "age": 34,
    "group": "treatment"
}

```

```{python}
print("hello world")

```


```{r}
print("hello world")
```

#### Section 2: Simple uses for R? ####
```{r}
9+12
```

```{r}
43*34+(4/3)-12
```

```{r}
print(29+1)
```

#### Section 3: Strengths of R in creating indices ####
You can create a little index (or vertex)
```{r}
a <- c(2,5,65,43,3)
```


## you can do some basic stats
```{r}
mean(a)
```

```{r}
sd(a)
```

# in R, integers are only whole numbers
```{r}
b <- c(1:5)
#b <- as.numeric(b)
```

### creating a matrix 
```{r}
c <- rbind(a,b) # row bind
d <- cbind(a,b) # column bind
```

#### Section 4: Reading in Data ####
## R users will say unusual things like Tidyverse and ggplot
### often we are referring to libraries.

```{r}
library(readr)
library(tidyverse)
```

# read in data using a function from the readr library
```{r}
data <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmp243/AZLA_2025_Data/refs/heads/main/fake_program_data.csv")

```

# Data analysis
What type of data are we looking at?
```{r}
head(data)
```


```{r}
cls <- sapply(data, class)
cls <- as.data.frame(cls)
cls
```

A summary is not too helpful when we only have one variable that is an integer.
```{r}
summary(data)
```
#### Section 5: Exploratory Data Analysis ####
```{r}
table(data$Branch.Location)
```

Look at other variables that way too.

```{r}
table(data$Target.Audience)
```
